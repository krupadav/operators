# operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. The different types of operators are as given ahead:
1. Arithmatic operato:-'+' Used for addition if operated on numbers,if we apply on string it conjugate the strings between the strings they are ooperated on.
 '-' substraction between values, '*'performs multiplication between the values '/' performs division '//' floor division that is if any numbers are not perfectly divisible and if we perform this then it will give just the complite number '**'exponential operator that is it gives power of the given number '=' assignment operator 2.Relational operators--->less than(<), greater than(>),less than equal to(<=),greater than equal to(>=),equal to equal to(==)3,not equal to(!=). This all give boolean output that is true or false.3 Assigned operator 4.Logical operator (and, or, not)5.Membership operator(in, not in) 6.Identity operator(is, is not) 7.Ternary operator 8.Bitwise operator
